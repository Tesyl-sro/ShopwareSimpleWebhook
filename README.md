# Simple Webhooks for Shopware 6

This is a simple Shopware 6 plugin that allows you to create webhooks for various events in your Shopware store. You can configure the webhooks to send data to a specified URL whenever certain events occur, such as order creation, customer registration, or product updates.

While Shopware 6 has support for webhooks using their Flow Builder, it requires a commercial license. This plugin provides a free alternative for basic webhook functionality.

### Why use webhooks?
Webhooks can help automate workflows and integrate your Shopware store with other services. For example, you can use webhooks to integrate with N8N, Zapier, or custom applications to perform actions like sending notifications, updating external databases, or triggering other processes.
